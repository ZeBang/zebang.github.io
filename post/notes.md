## Notes on Functional Analysis

张恭庆《泛函分析讲义》是一本好书，这里是我的学习笔记，旨在并做适当总结，对书中的GAP和错误予以说明，。

### Chapter 1 Metric Space

* **metric space** is a set with distance.

* **distance** is a real-valued bi-variate function.

* The reason to define distance is to describe **convergence**.

* The concept of **close** set and **complete** can be introduced to metric space.

* Given two metric space, we can define **continuous mapping**, **contraction mapping**.

* One important theorem related to contraction mapping is **Banach fixed-point theorem**.

  

  **Example 1.1.7** Uniform convergence preserves the continuity of continuous functions。

  **Definition 1.1.10** Contraction mapping must be continues mapping.
